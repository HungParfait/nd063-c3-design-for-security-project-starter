# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Put 2 EC2 instances into private subnet.
- Set up AWS WAF to detect potential attack.
- Setup Gateway Endpoint to provide private access to S3 bucket.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No. VPC private endpoints is a solution to privide private connection to S3 so it doesn't help resolve insecure IAM permissions.  

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Now, all data will be default encrypted when uploaded to S3. But before, default encryption is not appylied for already exists data.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
There will be potential attacks to this environment.
